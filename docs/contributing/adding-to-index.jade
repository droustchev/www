    Packages are specified by creating a JSON file in [the index repository](https://github.com/zulu-zsh/index) with the name of the package.

    Below is an example JSON file with comments added for explanatory purposes. Comments should *not* be included in any submissions.

    > **NOTE:** Zulu uses a very simple JSON parser, which has one big limitation, in that nested objects or arrays within the JSON object **must not** contain any newlines. Follow the formatting below and you should be fine.

    ```json
    {
      "name": "my-awesome-package",
      "description": "A short description of the package",
      "author": "Your Name <https://github.com/your-username>",
      "repository": "https://github.com/your-username/your-repository",

      // (optional) Can be one of 'script', 'plugin' or 'theme'
      // Themes will be enabled immediately after they are installed
      "type": "script",

      // (optional) A list of packages this package depends on, and which
      // will be installed at the same time
      "dependencies": ["a-package", "another-package"],

      // (optional) An object containing files in the repository, and the name
      // of a symlink that will be created and placed in $PATH
      "bin": {"path/to/executable": "command-name"},

      // (optional) An object containing files in the repository, and the name
      // of a symlink that will be created and placed in $fpath
      "share": {"path/to/script": "module-name"},

      // (optional) An object containing files in the repository, and the name
      // of a symlink that will be created and sourced on shell startup
      "init": {"path/to/script": "script-name"}

      // The bin, share and init keys may contain glob paths, which will create
      // multiple links in the relevant directory automatically
      "share": {"src/*": ""}
    }
    ```
